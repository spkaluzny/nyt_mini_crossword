# Analysis of times for the New York Times Mini Crossword.

A number of people are doing the New York Times Mini Crossword.
Everytime they do the puzzle they text me their time and the
time of day that they did the puzzle.

I have been recording these observations in this repository along
with code to analyze the results.

Questions:
 - do the puzzles get harder through the week?
 - do individuals do better on the puzzle at particular times of the day?
 - how do we compare in puzzle times amongst the players?
